    "AboutWebsiteP1":       "I made this website to show what I can do as a programmer. I really enjoy coding, so working on this project was a lot of fun and a great way to sharpen my skills. I also wanted to learn more about how domains and server-side development work, and building this site taught me a lot. Hopefully, you’ll find the site fun to explore.",

I also really enjoy game development and have made a few games in the past. I enjoy learning new skills and turning ideas into real things, and I'm always excited to dive into something new. I also love meeting new people and making new friends — sharing ideas and learning from others keeps things exciting for me.",

    "AboutJSShowcaseP1":    "This is a recreation of the three body problem, you can set the mass of each star and hit reset to confirm, i wanted to show my basic knowlage of java script and also my background in game development, as this shares a lot of logic and math with vectors. I plan to work on it further and maybe add colisions in the future, but i am happy with the state which it is in now. Feel free to try different combinations, and i would apreciate feedback if something is not working."
